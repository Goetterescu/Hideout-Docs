Discord Server Rules:
 
1. Please try not to send message after message, just condense it into one
2. Make sure you post in the correct channel, if you are unsure just ask one of the staff, also keep off-topic discussion if any to a minimum 
3. No need to insult or berate others in any way, if you can't resist the urge take it to dm's
4. No spamming of any sort
5. Please pay attention to these rules, if you break one and proceed to say "I didn't know" then that's on you and will still be punished for it
6. Please listen to Staff 

You can always ask a Moderator for any clarification on these
