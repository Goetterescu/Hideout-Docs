        <h3>Discord Server Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>§1<br>
            Please try not to send message after message, just condense it into one.</li>
            <li>§2<br>
            Make sure you post in the correct channel, if you are unsure just ask one of the staff, also keep off-topic discussion if any to a minimum.</li>
            <li>§3<br>
            No need to insult or berate others in any way, if you can't resist the urge take it to dm's.</li>
            <li>§4<br>
            No spamming of any sort.</li>
            <li>§5<br>
            Please pay attention to these rules, if you break one and proceed to say "I didn't know" then that's on you and will still be punished for it.</li>
            <li>§6<br>
            Please listen to Staff.</li>
            <li>§7<br>
            You can always ask Staff for clarification on any of the rules, please let us know if anything's confusing you.</li>   
            <li>§8<br>
