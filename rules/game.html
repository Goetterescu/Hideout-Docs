            </li> 
            <li>§6<br> 
            You may see the bot driving around, this is a pre-recorded path created by a staff member. Do not get into the way of the bot.

            <li>§7<br> 
            You have to keep collisions enabled at all times.

            </li>
            <li>§10<br>
            Just because you're able to spawn a vehicle, doesn't mean it is allowed. You will still be kicked.
