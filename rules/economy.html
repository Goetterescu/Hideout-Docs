        <h3>Economy Law:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>§1<br>
            The Economy System is a requirement for every player who wants to be a complete member of the game server.</li>
            <li>§2<br>
            Players can join factions and companies. They are free to request to join one or to create their own.</li>
            <li>§3<br>
            Players will be paid at the end of every month. Players can be part of multiple factions or companies.</li>
            <li>§4.1<br>
            The salary for each member of a faction/company is the same, expect for the leader. This salary does not need any logging, this might 
            change at some point. Players have to expect issues when it comes to their payday.</li><ul>
                <li>§4.2<br>
                Every faction/company has its own "value". This will depend on the influence which it produced and how it impacted the server.
                The value is usually a number between 0,1 and 2,0. This will be set by the Moderators at the end of each month, so it will 
                affect the next payday right away.</li>
                <li>§4.3<br>
                The salary will be paid by Beholder.</li>
                <li>§4.4<br>
                Every member of a faction/company has a base cashout of 1000 Gigis. This will be modified with the value of the player's 
                faction/company and result in his real salary. A value of 0,85 would result in a salary of 850 Gigis for the current month.</li>
                <li>§4.5<br>
                Leaders of factions and companies will receive two times the salary of their members.</li></ul>
            <li>§5<br>
            Police officers, judges, as well as lawyers are not allowed to be paid by civilians for any service.</li>
            <li>§6<br>
            Playing against any of the rules in here will result, as always, in a ban or similar penalty.</li>
            <li>§7<br>
            Players have to pay their fines and other currency related doings. Please use the economy system as often as possible. This way we 
            can maintain a stable and living economy.</li>
            <li>§8<br>
            Be corrupt, play against the economy, but don't overdo it. We know that there are black sheeps even in the real life economy.</li>
            <li>§9.1<br>
            Factions and companies are two different types of businesses. Each one has to follow a set format.</li><ul>
                <li>§9.2<br>
                Factions can not have official members but multiple leaders. 
                The leaders are allowed to pay other players for using the respective <abbr title="You can get a list of roles by using the '-publics' command in-game">in-game role</abbr>.</li>
                <li>§9.3<br>
                Factions have to use their respective role mainly. The amount of players using that role will determine the value of the faction.</li>
                <li>§9.4<br>
                Companies can have multiple members and one leader. Companies can use special rights and are allowed to use every in-game role.</li></ul>
            <li>§10<br></li>
            New businesses and members have to be approved by both the respective business and the staff members of the server.
        </ul>
