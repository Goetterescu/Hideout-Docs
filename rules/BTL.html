            <ul>
                <li>
                    §1<br>
                    Drivers have to follow international traffic laws and use common sense on public roads. 
                    The BTL, which includes the VCG, is only active on public roads and areas.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        §1.1<br>
                        Common sense is a major factor on our roads. There are many unwritten rules.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    §2<br>
                    All rules in the BTL have to be followed by all traffic members. Police officers and civilians can report traffic violations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §3<br>
                    There are rules which can overwrite other rules. Any rule can be overwriten, if another rule says something different. Please note that judges and police officers 
                    might understand the rules differently. Just use your common sense and justice will be on your side.
                    Everyone driver has to be able to understand the rules. Feel free to ask an police officer or 
                    moderator if you aren't able to understand a rule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §4<br>
                    Traffic signs can be ignored if they don't make sense. Otherwise Players have to follow the instructions given by those.

            <h4>Intersections and right of way:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    §101<br>
                    We are using a modified version of the traffic laws from the USA here. 
                    Cars have to stop, yield and/or continue into the intersection according to the type of intersection they are facing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §102<br>
                    Intersection with no traffic lights, signs or similar can be adressed as "unregulated intersections". Don't be confused by that name, 
                    these intersections are regulated, but in a light manner.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        §102.1<br>
                        Unregulated Intersections have to be slowly approached, vehicles don't have to come to an complete halt. The drivers will then continue, in the order in which they 
                        arrived. The first driver to approach the intersection will have to right to use the intersection first. Drivers don't have to yield for traffic, approaching the 
                        intersection from the front.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    §103<br>
                    Traffic lights are not working properly, therefore we are ignoring them. But they act like stop-signs for us.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        §103.1<br>
                        This means that all traffic has to come to an complete halt before continuing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    §104<br>
                    Edge lines indicate that an road has the right of way. Traffic from side roads has to yield for the vehicles which are using the lane with the edge line. 
                    Drivers don't have to come to an complete stop here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §105<br>
                    U-Turns are generaly not allowed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §106<br>
                    You have to yield for vehicles coming from the front, if you want to turn left.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §107<br>
                    It is allowed to cross solid and double solid lines, if you are turning. Some intersections feature these lines, so you can ignore them when turning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §108<br>
                    Drivers who want to park or maneuvor their vehicle/combination around have to yield for all other traffic and not block their path.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        §108.1<br>
                        Drivers who already began their maneuvor or parking process, after following the above, have the right of way and can continue their move even when other traffic is 
                        approaching. All other traffic has to yield and keep safe distance from the maneuvering vehicle/combination.
