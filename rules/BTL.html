                    §1<br>
                    Drivers have to follow international traffic laws and use common sense on public roads. 
                    The BTL, which includes the VCG, is only active on public roads and areas.

                    <li>
                        §1.1<br>
                        Common sense is a major factor on our roads. There are many unwritten rules.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    §2<br>
                    All rules in the BTL have to be followed by all traffic members. Police officers and civilians can report traffic violations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §3<br>
                    There are rules which can overwrite other rules. Any rule can be overwriten, if another rule says something different. Please note that judges and police officers 
                    might understand the rules differently. Just use your common sense and justice will be on your side.
                    Everyone driver has to be able to understand the rules. Feel free to ask an police officer or 
                    moderator if you aren't able to understand a rule.

                <li>
                    §4<br>
                    Traffic signs can be ignored if they don't make sense. Otherwise drivers have to follow the instructions given by those.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §5<br>
                    We are using the metric system on our roads, so all road signs have to be read in km/h.

                    §101<br>
                    We are using a modified version of the traffic laws from the USA here. 
                    Cars have to stop, yield and/or continue into the intersection according to the type of intersection they are facing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    §102<br>
                    Intersection with no traffic lights, signs or similar can be adressed as "unregulated intersections". Don't be confused by that name, 
                    these intersections are regulated, but in a light manner.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        §102.1<br>
                        Unregulated intersections have to be slowly approached, vehicles don't have to come to an complete halt. The drivers will then continue, in the order in which they 
                        arrived. The first driver to approach the intersection will have to right to use the intersection first. Drivers don't have to yield for traffic, approaching the 
                        intersection from the front.

                        §102.2<br>
                        There are no "protected turns". See §104.1 for more about turning lanes in intersections.

                <li>
                    §103<br>
                    Traffic lights are not working properly, therefore we are ignoring them. But they act like stop-signs for us.

                    §104<br>
                    Edge lines indicate that an road has the right of way. Traffic from side roads has to yield for the vehicles which are using the lane with the edge line. 
                    Drivers don't have to come to an complete stop here.

                    You have to yield for vehicles coming from the front, if you want to turn left. This law is not for intersections (see §102.1).

                    Some intersections feature these lines, so you can ignore them when turning.

                        approaching. All other traffic has to yield and keep safe distance from the maneuvering vehicle/combination.
