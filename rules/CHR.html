            <li>2<br>
            The target case has to be still active. This means that only cases which have been submitted during the current month 
            can be appealed against in the respective month.</li>
            <li>3<br>
            A judge, which would be any Moderator, should be active.</li>
            <li>4<br>
            Same goes for the reporter or officer who reported the suspect.</li>
