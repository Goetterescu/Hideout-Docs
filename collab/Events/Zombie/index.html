        <h2>General Information</h2>

        <p>
            There will be one supervising Moderator. Their job is to tell the story and keep track of the actions of each player. 
            The zombies and other events during this quest will be controlled and told by them as well. Players can use the -roll command to try for their own actions. 
            There will be not many fixed attributes or skills, like in pen and paper games. The "Gamemaster" will control the events.<br><br>
            Every player will receive 20 HP at the start of their game. 
            The quest will last for two days and everyone can participate multiple times whenever they want to. 
            The only requirement is to know the rules, how the game works and there has to be an Gamemaster online during the quest. 
            There will be no leader-board. It will not 
            matter how good or bad you are at this special event, just have fun!<br><br>
            Quick info about advantage: Sometimes you will find yourself in an situation where you have advantage or disadvantage.<br>
            Advantage means that you can roll twice and use the greater throw.<br>
            Disadvantage is the opposite - roll twice and take the smaller number.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>

        <p>
            D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 and D20 dices will be used for this quest, they are all included in the -roll command. 
            Please note that there will be also advantage and disadvantage rolls. 
            Those are not included in the -roll command, so you will have to use the respective command twice and use the better or worse throw.<br><br>
            Gamemasters will be rolling for the NPC's and other stuff during the quest. 
            Players on the other hand will roll for their own attacks and similar. There will three abilities only. 
            <ul id="info_list">
                <li onclick="attribute_info('hp')">Health</li>
                <li onclick="attribute_info('dex')">Dexterity</li>
                <li onclick="attribute_info('str')">Strength</li>
                <li onclick="attribute_info('wis')">Wisdom</li>
            </ul>
            Your HP will be set to 20, as mentioned above (this is no ability) and your abilities will be set to zero. But you can give a total of two points to any 
            of the three abilities and even subtract the modifier of any and transfer the subtracted points onto a different ability. Please note that this will 
            logically result in an negative modifier, this means that you will have to subtract that from your throws.<br>Example: You want to make an strength check 
            and have an -2 modifier on that ability. You role an 12, subtract two points from that and end up with a throw value of 10.
            <br><br>
            This whole thing might sound complicated but we are not forced to stick to the rules too much, having fun is more important. 
            One more thing: You, the player, will just have to play along with the story told by the GM and tell him what you want to do next. He will tell you 
            if you need to roll a dice and if yes, which one. The type of die depends on the difficulty of the situation. You will have to meet a score, usually 
            10 in order to succeed. Just don't forget to add your modifier to every throw. The modifier is what makes every character unique.

        <i>
            A mysterious virus arrived on the shores of Starling Island last week, according to leading scientists. 
            Little did the vacationers know that the inhabitants had become sick. Invisible, nearly undetectable on immediate contact, until... it happens.
